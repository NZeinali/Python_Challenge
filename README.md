# Python Project

## PyBank

![Revenue](Images/revenue-per-lead.png)

* In this project, a Python script is created for analyzing the financial records of a company based on their financial dataset called [budget_data.csv](PyBank/budget_data.csv) that is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`.

* The task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

## PyPoll

![Vote Counting](Images/Vote_counting.png)

* In this project, a set of poll data called [election_data.csv](PyPoll/election_data.csv) is used to create a Python script that analyses the votes and calculates each of the following:

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.
